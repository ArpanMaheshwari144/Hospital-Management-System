## Installation
Ohh! installation. No, you did not need any thing except only a text-editor like Visual Studio Code:slightly_smiling_face:.

## Getting Started
- Download the source code.
- Extract it where ever you want in your device.
- Change the name of your folder what ever you want.
- If you download Visual Studio Code then simply right click on that folder and click on open with code.
- Now go to extensions section and install live server extension.
- Once live server extension is installed, you can see a Go Live button in bottom right of the Visual Studio Code. If not, then simply restart Visual Studio Code.
- Now open index.html file. Once file is open now right click anywhere on that file and simply click on Open with live server:point_left:.
- Now your file is ready on the URL:- http://127.0.0.1:5500/Index.html. By the help of Live Server extension.
- For any reason if your file is not open by the Live Server, you can open any browser and type 127.0.0.1/index.html or simply double click on that file. 
- If you take care of every steps that I shown here you did not face any difficulty.
- Now enjoy the code:fire:.
